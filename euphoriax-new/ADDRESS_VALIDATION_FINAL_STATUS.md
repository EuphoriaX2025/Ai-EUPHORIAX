# Address Validation & Transaction Flow - Implementation Complete

## ✅ STATUS: READY FOR FINAL TESTING

Both development and preview servers are running and ready for comprehensive testing of the address validation and transaction flow.

## 🌐 Test Environments

- **Development**: http://localhost:5174
- **Preview (Production)**: http://localhost:4174

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED

### 1. Address Validation (`/src/utils/addressValidation.ts`)
- ✅ Accepts both checksummed and non-checksummed addresses
- ✅ Auto-corrects non-checksummed addresses to proper format
- ✅ Provides clear validation states: valid, warning, invalid
- ✅ Comprehensive error messages for different scenarios

### 2. Dashboard Integration (`/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)
- ✅ Form handling with proper address validation
- ✅ Auto-correction effect for warning state addresses
- ✅ Send button enabled for both valid and auto-correctable addresses
- ✅ Proper error and success modal management

### 3. Transaction Hook (`/src/hooks/useTransfer.ts`)
- ✅ Proper wagmi integration without premature state setting
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and state calculation
- ✅ Reset functionality for clean transaction states

### 4. Modal Flow
- ✅ Send modal → Transaction → Success/Error modal sequence
- ✅ User cancellation handled gracefully (no error modal)
- ✅ Proper body scroll management for mobile
- ✅ No modal interference or duplication

## 🧪 TEST CASES TO VERIFY

### Address Validation Tests
1. **Valid Checksummed**: `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8C6c5b738F0b2dcC1`
   - Expected: Green checkmark, send button enabled

2. **Non-Checksummed**: `0x742d35cc6634c0532925a3b8c6c5b738f0b2dcc1`
   - Expected: Orange warning → auto-corrects → send button enabled

3. **Invalid Address**: `0x742d35cc6634c0532925a3b8c6c5b738f0b2dc`
   - Expected: Red X, error message, send button disabled

### Transaction Flow Tests
1. **User Cancellation**: Start transaction → cancel in wallet
   - Expected: Modal closes gracefully, no error shown

2. **Successful Transaction**: Complete transaction with valid inputs
   - Expected: Success modal with transaction hash

3. **Failed Transaction**: Attempt with insufficient gas/funds
   - Expected: Error modal with appropriate message

## 🎯 KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

- **Flexible Address Validation**: Accepts multiple address formats
- **Auto-Correction**: Seamlessly fixes address formatting
- **Robust Transaction Handling**: Comprehensive error management
