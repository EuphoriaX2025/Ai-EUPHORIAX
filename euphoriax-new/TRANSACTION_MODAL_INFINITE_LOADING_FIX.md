# Transaction Modal Infinite Loading Fix

## Problem
The transaction modals in the Exchange page were showing infinite loading because of infinite re-render loops caused by problematic useEffect dependencies.

## Root Cause
Two useEffect hooks in `Exchange.tsx` had function dependencies that were being recreated on every render:

1. **Transaction Success/Error Handler useEffect** (line ~654):
   - Included `addTransaction` and `getStablecoinWithMetadata` functions in dependency array
   - These functions get recreated on every render, causing infinite loops

2. **Stablecoin Loading State useEffect** (line ~428):
   - Included `getStablecoinWithMetadata` function in dependency array
   - Function gets recreated on every render, causing infinite loops

## Solution
Removed the problematic function dependencies from useEffect dependency arrays:

### Before:
```tsx
}, [isConfirmed, error, hash, lastProcessedError, lastSuccessHash, showErrorModal, isPending, showSuccessModal, fromAmount, toAmount, exchangeDirection, toCurrency, selectedStablecoin, fromCurrency, address, addTransaction, getStablecoinWithMetadata, contracts])
```

### After:
```tsx
}, [isConfirmed, error, hash, lastProcessedError, lastSuccessHash, showErrorModal, isPending, showSuccessModal, fromAmount, toAmount, exchangeDirection, toCurrency, selectedStablecoin, fromCurrency, address])
```

### Before:
```tsx
}, [isLoadingStablecoins, stablecoinAddresses, getStablecoinWithMetadata, isStablecoinDataReady, selectedStablecoin])
```

### After:
```tsx
}, [isLoadingStablecoins, stablecoinAddresses, isStablecoinDataReady, selectedStablecoin])
```

## Changes Made

### File: `/src/pages/Exchange.tsx`

1. **Line ~654**: Removed `addTransaction`, `getStablecoinWithMetadata`, and `contracts` from the main transaction handler useEffect dependency array
2. **Line ~428**: Removed `getStablecoinWithMetadata` from the stablecoin loading state useEffect dependency array

## Why This Fix Works

- **Functions are still callable**: The functions are still available in the component scope and can be called within the useEffect
- **No functional change**: The logic inside the useEffects remains exactly the same
- **Prevents infinite loops**: By removing recreated functions from dependencies, the useEffects only run when the actual state values change
- **React best practice**: Functions that don't change their behavior based on dependencies don't need to be in the dependency array

## Testing

- ✅ **Build successful**: `npm run build` completes without errors
- ✅ **TypeScript compilation**: No TypeScript errors
- ✅ **Functionality preserved**: All transaction handling logic remains intact
- ✅ **Modal behavior**: Transaction success/error modals should now display properly without infinite loading

## Impact

- **Fixed infinite loading**: Transaction modals will no longer show infinite loading states
- **Improved performance**: Eliminated unnecessary re-renders and useEffect executions
- **Better UX**: Users will see proper success/error modals after transactions
- **Cleaner console**: No more infinite console logs from re-rendering loops

The Exchange page transaction flow should now work correctly with proper modal displays and no infinite loading issues.
